# Send Money Application

## Overview
The **Send Money Application** is a cross-platform mobile app designed to simplify money transfers, provide real-time wallet balance updates, and display transaction history. Built using Flutter, the app ensures high performance and supports offline functionality for a seamless user experience.

## Features
1. **Login & Authentication**:
    - Secure username and password login.
    - Persistent login state with the ability to log out on any screen.

2. **Dashboard**:
    - Display wallet balance with a show/hide feature.
    - Options to send money or view transaction history.

3. **Send Money**:
    - Input screen to enter transfer amount (numeric only).
    - Confirmation via a success or error message displayed in a bottom sheet.

4. **Transaction History**:
    - Detailed list of past transactions, including amounts and timestamps.

5. **Offline Mode**:
    - View the last fetched wallet balance and transaction history when offline.
    - Auto-sync with the server once the app regains connectivity.

6. **API Integration**:
    - Mock APIs (e.g., [jsonplaceholder.typicode.com](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)) for data simulation.
    - Perform GET and POST requests to fetch and update transactions.
